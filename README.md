## Customer Management Service

This is a simple CRUD-style service to manage customer records. It is part of a demo series on building an API Tool Kit of skills and command-line tools to build APIs for the Web.

You can find a (sometimes) running public instance of this project here: http://customers.atk.herokuapp.com/

_NOTE: The heroku instance is restarted every 25 hours or so. That means any service records added within the previous 24 hours are purged out._
