## Registry PoC

This is a proof-of-concept "open-discovery" registry. It shows what might be possible when implementing real-time service advertisting, discovery, and health-check/renwals.

You can find a (sometimes) running public instance of this project here: http://rwmbook-registry.herokuapp.com/

_NOTE: The heroku instance is restarted every 25 hours or so. That means any service records added within the previous 24 hours are purged out._
